# Flutter Supabase Gmail Login App (TopAi24.com assignment)

This is a Flutter app where users can login with Gmail. After login, it shows their email and some info from Google. Then they can fill out details like address, phone, age etc. and it saves to Supabase.

Thereâ€™s a home screen for entering info, a profile screen to logout, and a delete screen to remove the info (just clears personal data like address, phone etc., not the whole account). When you login again, the info comes back if it was saved.
